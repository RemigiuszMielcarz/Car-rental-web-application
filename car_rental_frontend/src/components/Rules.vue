    <h1>Car rental rules</h1>

    <div>
      The car can be picked up at our showroom in Wroc≈Çaw or, for an additional fee, we can deliver it to the indicated place throughout Poland! Transport prices are determined individually each time, depending on the distance and duration of the rental.
      You must have a valid driving license, issued at least one year before the start of the rental. We reserve the right to refuse a rental without giving any reason.

      If your car damage occurred in road traffic (e.g. someone hit your car and we will have liability insurance for the perpetrator) then you are excluded from liability. However, if the damage occurred e.g. in a local parking lot (the car was not properly secured during the stop), or you cause an accident / collision - then you are responsible for the damage up to the amount specified in the rental agreement (deductible in the damage).
      Contact us by phone or e-mail, we will arrange a convenient rental date, make an advance payment to the bank account provided by us, after these activities the date will be reserved for you.
      It is worth knowing that a previously rented vehicle can only be driven by the person who rented it. It is closely related to safety - both for you and the cars themselves, which are always properly prepared for work.
